# Comp.are

Our Hack the North 2020++ project was a Discord bot that looks at profiles from an online judge platform (a site to practice competative programming problems) and comprehensively compares them using on a radial plot of favoured programming langauges, ranking, points, and problems solved. This allows users to very quickly compare thier programming language proficiencies, and their competance in competative porgramming.

## How it works

We used the public API for the online judge [DM::OJ](https://dmoj.ca) to obtain data about user's profiles and submisisons.
